Tamagotchi Pet made with a Microbit and Python

Knock-off tamagotchi made for middle schoolers for python practice.

If you don't know, The Tamagotchi is a small handheld device with a simple LCD screen and three buttons, making it easy to play and carry around. 
The game involves taking care of a virtual pet by feeding it, playing with it, and attending to its various needs. 
They were super popular when I was a kid, so I thought it would be a fun project for my middle school Python 2 class. There is a version on the offical Microbit site but I wanted a little more from it.

materials: a Microbit, a USB cable, and a computer
